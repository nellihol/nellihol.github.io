description: Researching the user experience of the online presence of QUT Entrepreneurship program. Creating user personas and design ideas and iterations.
description-long: Generally speaking, the focus lies on the Orbit within this portfolio, even as there exist many different pages of QUT Entrepreneurship with redundant information, only the content of the QUT Orbit is analysed and improved. The described and presented prototype later on displays inter-face improvement ideas, without commenting the technical architecture or implementation. Furthermore, it has to be mentioned, that not all content is showcased within this portfolio, it moreover presents snippets of content and logic order. In addition, the target audience has been set to current as well as possible future foundry members.
